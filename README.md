# petHotel (unfinished group project)

Your team has started a new business in Uptown for dog-enthusiasts that also need to vacation without their beloved pets. You will be using Trello to track your progress on this application, and you will be using this project to practice git branching.

Create an application that allows owners to:
  - check in their pet
  - check out their pet
  - update their pet's info
  - remove their pet altogether
You'll use CRUD to make this happen.
